California,2020-08-01,Gov Cuomo just this week stated even in New York the worst hit of all the states hospitals were not overwhelmed As a country United States has the resources and money to fight covid 19 We are at the first place in covid cases is because of Trump s ineffectiveness to do his job I blame trump for covid surge in the United States With the U S entering into the Third Wave of COVID 19 I wouldn t be surprised to see another lockdown or severe restrictions put in place in November yo This entire article is a telling window into delusional view that California s response to the COVID 19 pandemic has been a resounding success for Californians and public health Check out my latest COVID 19 blog on yo No Donald If we don t get a handle on coronavirus we will have no recovery It really feels like you are doing your best to add to the suffering of the people that you swore to protect BlameTrump No it s not COVID a beta coronavirus Two of the endemic coronavirus that circulate annually are beta coronaviruses COVID is not that different genetically or Immunologically It may be the first coronavirus pandemic we have been aware of but coronaviruses are not new Donald You know how dangerous coronavirus is and you know the consequences The fact you are still having Super spreading rallies is down right evil At first I thought you were just stupid Then I thought Putin had something on you Now I think you might be the Antichrist Keep your mouth shut so you don t spread more coronavirus No Eric you Trumps are wrong Having these big rallies during a pandemic is evil Can t wait till you are in prison So mean I don t comment on Carl s Tweets for the same reason I don t comment Sridhars Feigel Ding s or similar minded scientists Bc their views on the pandemic are typically not based on anything I recognize as science I don t think it would lead to productive conversation Florida is doing ok The others will once their outbreaks end You can t wait out a pandemic It s not a storm We re not Asia The U S population are not going to overhaul their entire way of life to eradicate a now endemic virus that s mostly lethal to a small minority of elderly frail Individuals and unlikely to cause large mortality spikes once pandemic subsides No matter how much I m not sure I really know what is happening in China but even if they have permanently suppressed COVIF forever and will never allow it back into the country they are an outlier in the world Do you think science medicine and pandemic response should be based on an anomaly You knew the timeframe for Ebola No reason COVID should last longer than a flu pandemic With sustainable PH measures that support the vulnerable while enabling society 2 function it wouldn t be as worrying Sadly were 2 distracted failing at suppression 2 enact such a response Or perhaps overreacting and shutting down society is putting more people at risk than moving to a more rational pandemic response When society becomes fearful to the point it can no longer function that can be equally as dangerous as a pandemic Yep Not unique to COVID Other respiratory viruses cause these issues too They become more noticeable in a pandemic when there are higher of infections but respiratory viruses are nasty all the time I m not teaching online I ve worked in person in the lab amp taught in person throughout the pandemic I m not worried about catching COVID I m happy to contribute to immunity to help protect the vulnerable I had a nasty flu Feb that knocked me out for 2 months hopefully COVID face though it has dominated public health disproportionately You obviously think COVID response should dominate reshape societal function amp public health Not everyone agrees with you I see the same data I m not denying any aspect of the pandemic from the mortality spike to Yes Pandemics are scary You ve clearly adopted a worst case scenario opinion of every aspect of the pandemic There s nothing 2 stop u staying home waiting for a vaccine etc Not everyone shares your view Those who wish 2 resume their lives should be free 2 adopt that risk I get for Osterholm it must be exciting to finally have the pandemic he s been planning for all these years But for society real people with jobs bills and other personal health concerns life doesn t revolve around the control and elimination of one single disease I recognize long COVID I just don t think it s a reason to shut down the world or focus all efforts on this one disease COVID is not the only disease and pandemics are transient unlike many of the societal challenges that have been pushed aside in the pandemic response a vaccine either It will be the first never ending respiratory virus pandemic Let s see what happens I never denied COVID is killing people Quite the opposite I think the death toll is high amp we could have done better to protect the elderly with age targeted strategies Let s circle back in a year from now after we see how it plays out in real life What you are suggesting is that COVID is a virus so novel for which there can be no lasting immunity if this is true then the pandemic would essentially never end If that s true it won t end with No flu pandemic has ended with a vaccine only pandemic in history that never ends How are the gt 200 resp viruses that circulate annually controlled in the population in a permanent pandemic from endemic CoV Why not if the immunity cannot control the transmission of CoV in the population Do you think every person will lose immunity to COVID sequentially amp to the level needed to plunge us back into another pandemic Is COVID going to be the People haven t been accessing health care regardless of hospital capacity because they re too scared The quicker the pandemic comes to an end the quicker people can feel safe going the hospital again The vast majority of hospitals have had capacity for COVID amp regular patients Im sure COVID will be endemic after which high levels of mortality are Unlikely COVID has caused similar mortality levels to pandemic flu You can t compare pandemic mortality levels to endemic flu seasons through outbreaks amp move past the pandemic Suppressing the pandemic keeps the population susceptible to outbreaks and a never ending cycle of economically devastating closures and restrictions The economy is being hurt because of the business closures because we are dragging out the pandemic by slowing it down amp because society has been scared into a hermit like existence by misinformation amp irrational fear mongering The economy won t recover until states open go reduce as much as possible understanding we won t be able to save every life no matter what we do The world can t stop because we re experiencing a pandemic It s not the only societal or health concern No but we don t know how many people endemic CoV killed when they first emerged It could have been more than COVID You can not compare endemic flu seasons to a pandemic They are not comparable Pandemics are natural disasters that cause mortality spikes which we should try to many elderly people that could die if the pandemic is not mitigated properly infection but very likely reduces disease symptoms Any existing immunity is baked into the outcome of the pandemic which for the vast majority of the population is not severe That doesn t mean the vulnerable fraction is small amp should be ignored On the contrary there are No it s not COVID a beta coronavirus Two of the endemic coronavirus that circulate annually are beta coronaviruses COVID is not that different genetically or Immunologically It may be the first coronavirus pandemic we have been aware of but coronaviruses are not new This entire article is a telling window into delusional
